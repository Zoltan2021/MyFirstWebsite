            <p>
                Since 2017, I have been studying Front-end Web Development on my own. My knowledge of English - which I also achieved in the above way - helps me reach my goal a great deal.
            </p>
            <p>
                My goal in the programming career is to get to a level that will bring about positive changes in my personal life and the broader environment.

                Computer Program
            </h3>
            <p>
                A computer program is a collection of instructions that can be executed by a computer to perform a specific task. A computer program is usually written by a computer programmer in a programming language. From the program in its human-readable form of source code, a compiler or assembler can derive machine codeâ€”a form consisting of instructions that the computer can directly execute. Alternatively, a computer program may be executed with the aid of an interpreter.
